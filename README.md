This is a tutorial on how to exploit properly, the best executors, how to not get banned and way more stuff.

## The best executors
We won't be biased, we have collected information from developers, users, and more. First of all, let's rank every executor and then go in-depth about them.

## The ranks

**Popular, good, and reputable executors.**
1. Synapse X
2. Scriptware
4. KRNL

**Synapse X** - probably the most popular among the Roblox exploiting community, and alot of people use it. It has generally very good execution and a very good API. It's for new exploiters or advanced exploiters to run scripts that they love.

**Scriptware** - you probably haven't heard about this, because this isnt advertised for beginners. That's why it isn't first place, Synapse X is way more popular. Scriptware has good execution but doesn't have as much support compared to Synapse X.

**KRNL** - so this is really popular because it's free, it's execution isn't crap. Probably good for newbies and people that don't want to spend money.
